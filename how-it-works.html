Our model focuses on the use of a specially designed tablet, uploaded with easy-to-use and accessible science, math, and English-language education programs. These tablets are provided to students, allowing them to take control of their education at their own pace and in their own privacy.</p>

							<p class="col-sm-12 how-it-works-description ">Brightline selects high achieving individuals from a variety of backgrounds as educational ambassadors, who travel to rural areas across the globe and remain on-site as accessible resources for rural students using our tablets. Our Brightline Ambassadors are leaders, educators, and lifelong students whom Brightline trains to  work with the students and reinforce the education that our tablets provide. Brightline Ambassadors answer any science, math, or English-language question our students have. Brightline Ambassadors will serve a multi-functional role. They will be trained to answer any substantive questions students may have in the course of their education. They will also be trained to answer any technological and functional questions regarding Brightline's education tablets for students, assuring that the program runs efficiently. We will work closely not only with students, but also with civil society, local government and universities, and community leaders to make a meaningful and lasting impact. </p>
